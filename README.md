## Bird Noise Machine Learning
Using a kaggle bird dataset to try to distinguish the type of bird making a sound through machine learning

### What I learned:
* Librosa
* Better understanding of ML fundamentals/algorithms
* Better understanding of the importance of EDA. Doing EDA allowed me to see distribution issues with the dataset, which then led me to realize I had to do Random Over Sampling.

### What I still need to do:
Make a program that utilizes the saved ML algorithm I made.
